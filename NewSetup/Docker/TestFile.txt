***************Pre check to ensure the docker is installed and running****************
--> Ensure that the docker is installed in your system 

rpm -q docker 

--> if it is not installed 

yum install docker -y 


--> verify the docker service is started 

systemctl status docker 


--> If it is not running 

systemctl start docker 

--> If you wanted to keep it always running even after the server reboot


systemctl enable docker 


--> To verify it is enabled on boot 


systemctl is-enabled docker 

Note: - These are Linux commands,  not the docker related commands 
 
******************************************************


Creating an image using docker file 
*********************************

Copy the below content into a file and name the file as Dockerfile 


--------------------------------
# Selected the base image 
FROM ubuntu
# updating the image and installing the nginx
RUN apt-get update -y ;DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -yq install nginx
# installing the curl 
RUN apt-get install curl -y
# Added startup entry 
ENTRYPOINT  ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

-------------------------------------

Steps 

--> Create a directory of your choice 

mkdir Dockersetup 

--> Change your working directory to the new directory 

cd Dockersetup

--> To confirm you are in that directory execute the command pwd -- present working directory 

pwd 

--> check the file is available 

ls -l 

--> List the currently available image in your system 

docker images 


docker build . -t ubuntu-nginx


--> Once the build is completed verify the image is created 


docker images 

----------------------------------


--> Running the image with the newly created image.


docker run -d  ubuntu-nginx  

Note : -d stands for a detached mode 


------------------------------

--> Image for a container 

--> Create a container with the ubuntu image 

docker run -it ubuntu

--> Once you get the container terminal, patch the container 

apt-get update -y 


--> Install the nginx 


DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -yq install nginx

--> Install curl 

apt-get install curl -y


--> Either take a new putty session or press control+c and come out from the running container 


--> execute the below command to get the container id 

docker ps -a  -- Make a not of container id 

--> Execute the below command to create an image from the container  

docker commit 381aed84d139 ubuntu-nginx-commit   -- replace your container id in this command 

--> Verify the image is created 

docker images  

--> Create a container with newly created images 

docker run -it ubuntu-nginx-commit


--> Now you will be into the container 

--> execute ps command to find the running processes inside the container 

ps -ef

--> You will not find any running processes. 

--> Verify the status of nginx  

/etc/init.d/nginx status 

--> Start the service 

/etc/init.d/nginx start 

--> Verify the process again 

 ps -ef



--> Now if you wanted to expose the nginx outside the docker you can follow the below step 



root@shiva:~# docker run -it -p 80:80 ubuntu-nginx-commit
root@d3d310d24c79:/# ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 10:41 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
root          10       1  0 10:41 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
root@d3d310d24c79:/# /etc/init.d/nginx status 
 * nginx is not running
root@d3d310d24c79:/# /etc/init.d/nginx start  
 * Starting nginx nginx                                                                      [ OK ] 
root@d3d310d24c79:/# ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 10:41 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
root          40       1  0 10:42 ?        00:00:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx
www-data      41      40  0 10:42 ?        00:00:00 nginx: worker process
www-data      42      40  0 10:42 ?        00:00:00 nginx: worker process
www-data      43      40  0 10:42 ?        00:00:00 nginx: worker process
www-data      44      40  0 10:42 ?        00:00:00 nginx: worker process
root          46       1  0 10:42 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
root@d3d310d24c79:/# 

now try accessing the nginx through the browser ( give your public IP in the web browser )
